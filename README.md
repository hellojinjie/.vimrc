.vimrc
======

### Script to install vim configuration files 
Tested with CentOS and Ubuntu. 
Will need  modifications for windows if home dir is not set

Easiest way to use this is to run this from your home folder in Terminal:
````
curl https://raw.github.com/hellojinjie/vimrc/master/vim.sh | sh
````

You'll need Vim, Git and Curl installed to use this script with bash.
